The topleft most subwindow shows the commit history of the repo. It shows a
visual of all the commit objects. A circle is a commit object, and the different
paths are the different branches. A path that moves laterally is a merge. The
middle top windows shows the author info of each commit or merge. The top right
window shows the timestamp of the commit or merge. The bottom left window shows
the commit info for the highlighted commit. It shows changes to lines, author
info, time, and the commit message, among other info. In the screenshot there
are no line changes because it's a merge. You can select tick boxes to view the
previous and new verions of files when there are line changes. In the bottom
right window there are different views for what was changed in the patch. For a
commit, it would show the different files that were changed. You can select
different files to view what was changed in them in the bottom left. You can
also select the tree option to view the filestructure of the repo. There is a
text box for the SHA1 hash of the highlighted commit, search options, and the
row number currently highlighted.
