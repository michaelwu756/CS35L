First I downloaded the diffutils repo with 

git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

and moved into the repo, then I checked out version 3.0 to a new branch called
quote by doing

git checkout -b quote v3.0

I copied my quote-3.0-patch.txt into the repo and did

patch -p1<quote-3.0-patch.txt

in order to apply the patch. I opened up emacs with the scrath buffer and made a
changelog entry with the text

*maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this' for diffutils v3.0
This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
`like this' or ``like this''. Comments are unchanged, only the outputs are
changed.
* src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
* src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value)
(compare_files):
* src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage)
(read_diff):
* src/dir.c (compare_names):
* src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):
* src/util.c (finish_output):
Quote 'like this' in output.

that reflects my changes. I saved the message to ChangeLog by doing C-x C-s in
emacs. Then I committed my changes with the changelog message by doing

git commit -a -F ChangeLog

Then I made a patch with

git format-patch -1 HEAD

which made a file
0001-2017-03-15-Michael-Donald-Wu-wum-lnxsrv03.seas.ucla..patch I renamed this
to formatted-patch.txt, copied this to my computer and sent this to my partner,
Jiale He, through email.
