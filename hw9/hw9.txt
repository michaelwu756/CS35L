First I downloaded the diffutils repo with 

git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

and moved into the repo, then I checked out version 3.0 to a new branch called
quote by doing

git checkout -b quote v3.0

I copied my quote-3.0-patch.txt into the repo and did

patch -p1<quote-3.0-patch.txt

in order to apply the patch. I opened up emacs with the scrath buffer and made a
changelog entry with the text

*maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this' for diffutils v3.0
This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
`like this' or ``like this''. Comments are unchanged, only the outputs are
changed.
* src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
* src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value)
(compare_files):
* src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage)
(read_diff):
* src/dir.c (compare_names):
* src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):
* src/util.c (finish_output):
Quote 'like this' in output.

that reflects my changes. I saved the message to ChangeLog by doing C-x C-s in
emacs. Then I committed my changes with the changelog message by doing

git commit -a -e -F ChangeLog

and editing the commit message so that it did not include the author
information in the ChangeLog file. Then I made a patch with

git format-patch -1 HEAD --stdout>formatted-patch.txt

which made a file formatted-patch.txt. I copied this to my computer and sent
this to my partner, Jiale He, through email. He sent me his patch, which I
downloaded on my windows machine and copied to the linux server with winSCP as
formatted-patch-partner.txt. Then I moved into my repo and did

git checkout -b partner v3.0

to make a new branch where I will apply my partner's patch. I copied Jiale's
patch into the repo and did

git am formatted-patch-partner.txt

to apply the changes. Then I did

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

to build and test the patched program. 88 tests were passed, and one did not
run. I changed back to my branch with

git checkout quote

I rebuilt diff, and then ran

make distdir

which made a folder diffutils-3.0.1-50a7. I looked in that folder's ChangeLog
and saw that it included all previous changes, with the last change being my
own.

Next I need to look at eggert's git repo for emacs. I cloned it with

git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs

Then I moved into it and ran

gitk
