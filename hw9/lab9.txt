First I cloned the diffutils repo with

git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

This downloaded a copy of the repo onto my local machine, into a folder called
diffutils. I moved into the diffutils folder and ran

git log>git-log.txt

to get a log of the changes and put it in a text file. The changes consist of
codes from every commit made to the repo. The changes span back to 1988. Then I
got the tags for the repo and put it in a text file with

git tag>git-tags.txt

Next I opened git-log.txt in emacs and searched for the commit entitled "maint:
quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'" using the C-s command in
emacs. I found that the commit was

62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
