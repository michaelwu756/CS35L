1. Use the command "man -k [string]" to search for all commands that
have a specific word in their man page.

I used 'man man' to figure this out.

2. cp is located at /bin and wc is located at /usr/bin.

I used 'whereis cp' and 'whereis wc' to find this info, respectively.

3. The three commands with only one character are [, X, and w. X is a
windows manager. [ is used for expressions to check file types and
compare values. w shows who is logged on and what they are doing.

I used 'find /usr/bin -executable -name ?' and 'find /bin -executable
-name ?' to list all the commands with one character in its name.
Then I used the man pages to find the descriptions. I googled that [
is the same as test, since there was no man page for it.

4. It points to /etc/alternatives/emacs.

I found this by using "ls -l /usr/bin/emacs".

5. The g+s,o-x mode adds the setgid bit and removes execute
permissions for others on a given file or directory.

I found this out by doing man chmod.

6. The option -mtime -21 does this.

I found this out by doing man find.

7. 'find / -mtime -21 -type d' is the command necessary to execute.

This follows from the previous answer.

8. There are 20 symbolic links in /bin, which is the directory of find.

I found this out by doing 'whereis find' to find the directory of
find, then doing 'find /bin -type l | wc' to count the number of
symbolic links in the directory.

9. libgamin-1.so.0.1.10 is the oldest regular file in /usr/lib

I did 'ls --sort=t -l /usr/lib' and looked at the last entry to find
this out.

10. locale gets data from the /usr/share/i18n directory.

I did localedef --help to find the system's directory for locale path.

sort.

C-M-a move backwards to the beginning of a defined function.
C-M-b move backwards across one balanced expression.
C-M-c exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.
C-M-d move forward down one level of parenthesis.
C-M-e move forward to the next end of a defined function.
C-M-f move forward arcross one balanced expression.
C-M-h mark the end of a defined function and point to the beginning.

I found this by doing M-x help RET b to find a help window with all
the commands.

13. The stroke C-g quits any stroke or program currently in progress.

I found this out by going through the tutorial.

14. The yank function takes the last entry that was killed and places
it at the current location of the cursor.

I found this out by going through the tutorial.

15. The colors are different and dired shows hidden files that start
with a period.

I found this out by trying out both commands on /usr/bin.
