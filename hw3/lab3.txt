To get coreutils 7.6, I did

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

in my home directory. Then I did

tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

to extract coreutils 7.6. Next I did

mkdir coreutilsInstall

to make an install folder.

I moved to ~/coreutils-7.6/ and ran

./configure --prefix='/u/cs/ugrad/wum/coreutilsInstall'
make
make install

to install into this folder. The configure command chooses the install
directory, while the make command determines what needs to be
compiled, and the make install command copies the files to the correct
install directory.

I can now reproduce the bug by running

/u/cs/ugrad/wum/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -l

which produces output that looks like

-rwxr-xr-x 1 wum csugrad 107211 2017-01-23 12:23 [

We want out put that looks like what you get when you run

ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x 1 wum csugrad 107211 Jan 23 12:23 [

So i moved into the directory

~/coreutils-7.6/

and used emacs to copy and paste the patch from the forum link
specified into a file patch_file

with the text from

--- a/src/ls.c
to
/* Note we leave %5b etc. alone so user widths/flags are honored.  */

Then I ran

patch -p1 <patch_file

to apply the patch. I used the flag -p1 because that removes
everything before and including the first backslash. Given the
directory I was in, that would lead to patching the correct file. Then
I ran

make

Because ~/coreutils-7.6/src/ls.c was modified, it was
recompiled. Next I verified that the command ~/coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l
correctly output what we wanted, and ~/coreutilsInstall/src/ls -l
output the wrong format.

I also made files with

touch -t 201501010000.00 ~/oldfile
touch -t 201701010000.00 ~/newfile

and ran the modified and unmodified ls -l on it to verify that the
patch worked. Running the new ls on an old file shows the year instead
of a time in the third column for the time. The outputs are as shown

new ls:
-rw-r--r-- 1 wum csugrad 0 Jan  1  2015 /u/cs/ugrad/wum/oldfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 wum csugrad 0 Jan  1 00:00 /u/cs/ugrad/wum/newfile

old ls:
-rw-r--r-- 1 wum csugrad 0 2017-01-01 00:00 /u/cs/ugrad/wum/newfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 wum csugrad 0 2015-01-01 00:00 /u/cs/ugrad/wum/oldfile
