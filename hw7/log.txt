I booted ubuntu from disk and ran the trial. Then I opened up the terminal and
checked what was installed using

dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

and saw that only the openssh-client was installed and i needed to install
openssh-server. So i did

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

to install the openssh-server package. My partner was Jiale He. On his computer
he installed openssh-sever as well, and then he did

ssh-keygen

and saved his keys in the default location ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
without a passphrase.
He made an account for me to connect to by doing

sudo useradd -d /home/Michael -m Michael
sudo passwd Michael

and when prompted he chose the password 'pass' for me. In /home/Michael/ he made
a .ssh directory by doing

cd /home/Michael/
sudo mkdir .ssh

and changed ownership and permissions so only I can access the folder with

sudo chown -R Michael .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

He then disabled password-based authentication by setting the
PasswordAuthentication option in the sshd_config file to no. To do this he had
to change the permissions with

sudo chmod 777 /etc/ssh/sshd_config

and edited the file by installing emacs with

sudo apt-get install emacs

and doing

sudo emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Now my account is all set up. Jiale got his ip address by doing

hostname -I

which output

10.97.85.145

To connect to the account that Jiale set up for me, I did 

ssh-keygen

and saved the keys in the default location with no password. I did

ssh-copy-id -i Michael@10.97.85.145

to copy my public key to the server. It prompted me for the password and I
entered 'pass'. Next I did

ssh-add

to add my private key to the ssh-agent on my own machine. Now i tried connecting
to the host by doing

ssh -X Michael@10.97.85.145

which was sucessful. I ran xterm and created a file to verify that I could
modify data on the host machine and forward windows correctly. It was sucessful.
